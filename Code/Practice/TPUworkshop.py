Notes
------
- Datasets = class for file handling
- JAX vs Pytorch
    - Pytorch, don't need to know math to do basic tasks
        - No explicit idea of calculating a loss
    - Jax makes things easier
        - Good if you understand theory (not me)
        - Easy to unit test :')
- Learning rate search
    - wandb library
    - tool for automatically searching learning rates
